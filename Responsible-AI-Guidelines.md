# Responsible AI Guidelines

This checklist outlines best practices for using AI-assisted tools responsibly.

## 1. Review and Validate AI-Generated Code
- Always read and understand code suggestions before integrating them.
- Test AI-generated code thoroughly to ensure correctness, security, and performance.
- Avoid blindly copying large blocks of code; use AI outputs as guidance.

## 2. Handling Sensitive Data Securely
- Do not include passwords, API keys, or personal data in AI prompts or generated code.
- Store secrets in environment variables or secure secret managers.
- Ensure compliance with privacy and data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).

## 3. Acknowledge AI Contributions Ethically
- Clearly indicate when code or content is assisted by AI tools.
- Maintain transparency in documentation or commit messages.
- Avoid claiming AI-generated work as solely human-authored if it contributes significantly.
